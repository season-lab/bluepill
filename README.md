# BluePill

**Update (Mar 4, 2020):** *An article on BluePill just got accepted at TIFS (see below). We are now extending the documentation! :-)*

**BluePill** is an open-source dynamic analysis framework for handling evasive malware. Its goal is to reconcile the transparency properties needed for automatic analyses with the fine-grained execution inspection and altering capabilities required for manual analysis. BluePill is an academic prototype under active development: as we share it as such, any feedback is greatly appreciated!

BluePill can counter many red pills targeting hypervisors, debuggers, third-party analysis tools (e.g. IDA Pro), and timing artifacts. It builds on dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) to monitor adversarial queries that a sample can make on the environment looking for artifacts, and fix them when their results would give away the presence of an automated analysis or a human agent.

BluePill offers a GDB remote interface to analysts to debug a sample, complemented by a stealth patching mechanisms to hide code changes made in the debugger from self-checksumming schemes.

We tested BluePill on heterogeneous PE32 malware running on 32-bit Windows 7 SP1: as an example, we can run executables protected with recent versions of VMProtect and Themida, and highly evasive samples like Furtim.

To counter DBI evasions, BluePill uses a [library of mitigations](https://github.com/season-lab/sok-dbi-security/) that we wrote for Intel Pin as part of our paper *SoK: Using Dynamic Binary Instrumentation for Security (And How You May Get Caught Red-Handed)* from ASIACCS 2019. We extended the library with further mitigations for time overheads and red pills targeting the GDB remote debugging interface and exception handling.

BluePill has been presented in:

*Before going public for BH Europe 2019, we made radical changes that broke the handling of 64-bit code and partially of the WoW64 subsystem: please consider these scenarios experimental as we complete the regression testing.*

### Quick start

BluePill builds on Intel Pin and requires Visual Studio 2015 for its compilation.

Extract a recent release of Pin to your disk drive and change the path-related property value in the Visual Studio project when needed: by default we assume Pin v3.11 installed in `C:\Pin311`. Once compilation ends, you will find a `bluepill32.dll` library in `C:\Pin311`. To run an executable under BluePill use:

```
C:\Pin311\pin.exe -t bluepill32.dll [options] -- <file.exe>
```

BluePill supports the following command-line options:

Option | Meaning
--- | --- 
`-evasions` | Detect and handle the majority of evasions supported (see below for DBI)
`-debugger` | Enable debugger mode via GDB remote interface
`-leak` | DBI evasions: fix leaks of real EIP (e.g. FPU instructions)
`-nx` | DBI evasions: check that code pages are executable
`-rw` | DBI evasions: hide pages that belong to the DBI engine

For instance, to run an evasive program named `sample.exe` in a sandbox-like automatic mode try:

```
C:\Pin311\pin.exe -t bluepill32.dll -evasions -leak  -- sample.exe
```

Enabling the `-leak` mitigation has minimal performance impact, while `-nx` and ultimately `-rw` can help with complex packers that attempt conformance checking on the address space of the program.

BluePill will create a file named `evasions.log` under Pin's folder `C:\Pin311` (modify the `LOGPATH` variable inside `pintool\src\logging.h` to change it) that logs possible evasion attempts intercepted during the execution.  

*>>> We will shortly extend this part and improve (with images) the guide below for setting up a remote GDB session from IDA Pro over BluePill. Please be patient with us for a little bit longer :-) <<<*

### Debugging via GDB remote interface

To access dissection capabilities of BluePill you need to connect from a debugger to the GDB remote interface of Pin. To this end you need to provide additional options when invoking Pin of the form:

```
C:\Pin311\pin.exe -appdebug â€”appdebug_server_port 10000 -t bluepill32.dll -debugger [other options] -- <file.exe>
```

And connect to the desired port number. The application will stay paused until you connect a debugger, but if you instead attach one to the process you will end up debugging Pin and the JIT-ted code. For IDA Pro users select the *Remote GDB debugger* option and connect to `localhost`. To map missing memory segments you can use the `AddSegments.py` IDAPython script available in the `scripts/` folder: we defined a custom `vmmap` GDB command that gets invoked by the script and transfers memory layout information from the pintool to the debugger.

Exception handling requires a workaround for the current GDB server implementation. When you need to pass an exception to the application just send a `wait` [monitor command](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idadoc/1335.shtml) right after you receive the exception message, then disconnect and reconnect IDA to BluePill, which meanwhile will put the execution on hold in response to the command.
